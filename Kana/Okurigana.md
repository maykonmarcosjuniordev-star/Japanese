 訓読み is also used in adjectives and verbs in addition to the stand-alone characters.
	- These words often have a string of kana (called Okurigana that come attached to the word.
- This is so that the reading of the Chinese character stays the same even when the word is conjugated to different forms.
- For example, the past form of the verb 「食べる」 is 「食べた」. Even though the verb has changed, the reading for 「食」 remain untouched.
- (Imagine how difficult things could get if readings for Kanji changed with conjugation or even worse, if the Kanji itself changed.)
- Okurigana also serves to distinguish between intransitive and transitive verbs (more on this later).
