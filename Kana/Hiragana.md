*Hiragana* is the basic Japanese phonetic script.
It represents every sound in the Japanese language.
- Therefore, you can theoretically write everything in Hiragana.
However, because Japanese is written with no spaces, this will create nearly indecipherable text.

# Hiragana Table

|     | n    | w    | r   | y   | m   | h     | n   | t      | s      | k   |     |
| --- | ---- | ---- | --- | --- | --- | ----- | --- | ------ | ------ | --- | --- |
| a   | ん(n) | わ    | ら   | や   | ま   | は     | な   | た      | さ      | か   | あ   |
| i   |      | ゐ*   | り   |     | み   | ひ     | に   | ち(chi) | し(shi) | き   | い   |
| u   |      |      | る   | ゆ   | む   | ふ(fu) | ぬ   | つ(tsu) | す      | く   | う   |
| e   |      | ゑ*   | れ   |     | め   | へ     | ね   | て      | せ      | け   | え   |
| o   |      | を(o) | ろ   | よ   | も   | ほ     | の   | と      | そ      | こ   | お   |
* `*` means it's no longer used

When practicing writing Hiragana by hand, the important thing to remember is that the stroke order and direction of the strokes _**matter**_.
- everybody writes in the same order and so the "flow" of the characters is fairly consistent.

Notes
1. Except for 「し」、「ち」、「つ」、and 「ん」、you can get a sense of how each letter is pronounced by matching the consonant on the top row to the vowel. For example, 「き」 would become / ki / and 「ゆ」 would become / yu / and so on.
2. As you can see, not all sounds match the way our consonant system works. As written in the table, 「ち」 is pronounced "chi" and 「つ」 is pronounced "tsu".
3. The / r / or / l / sound in Japanese is quite different from any sound in English. It involves more of a roll and a clip by hitting the roof of your mouth with your tongue. Pay careful attention to that whole column.
4. Pay careful attention to the difference between / tsu / and / su /.
5. The 「ん」 character is a special character because it is rarely used by itself and does not have a vowel sound. It is attached to another character to add a / n / sound. For example, 「かん」 becomes 'kan' instead of 'ka', 「まん」 becomes 'man' instead of 'ma', and so on and so forth.
6. You must learn the correct stroke order and direction! Use a Kana App, or pen and paper


# Pronounce Details

There special cases to watch for

## The Muddied Sounds

There are five more consonant sounds that are written by either affixing two tiny lines similar to a double quotation mark called *dakuten* （濁点）or a tiny circle called *handakuten* （半濁点）. 

This essentially creates a "muddy" or less clipped version of the consonant (technically called a voiced consonant or 「濁り」, which literally means to become muddy).

|     | p   | b   | d      | z     | g   |
| --- | --- | --- | ------ | ----- | --- |
| a   | ぱ   | ば   | だ      | ざ     | が   |
| i   | ぴ   | び   | ぢ(ji)  | じ(ji) | ぎ   |
| u   | ぷ   | ぶ   | づ(dzu) | ず     | ぐ   |
| e   | ぺ   | べ   | で      | ぜ     | げ   |
| o   | ぽ   | ぼ   | ど      | ぞ     | ご   |
Notes
1. Notice that 「ぢ」 sounds essentially identical to 「じ」 and both are pronounced as / ji /, while 「づ」 is pronounced like / dzu /.


## The Small 「や」、「ゆ」、and 「よ」

You can also combine a consonant with a / ya / yu / yo / sound by attaching a small 「や」、「ゆ」、or 「よ」 to the / i / vowel character of each consonant.

|     | p   | b   | j   | g   | r   | m   | h   | n   | c   | s   | k   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ya  | ぴゃ  | びゃ  | じゃ  | ぎゃ  | りゃ  | みゃ  | ひゃ  | にゃ  | ちゃ  | しゃ  | きゃ  |
| yu  | ぴゅ  | びゅ  | じゅ  | ぎゅ  | りゅ  | みゅ  | ひゅ  | にゅ  | ちゅ  | しゅ  | きゅ  |
| yo  | ぴょ  | びょ  | じょ  | ぎょ  | りょ  | みょ  | ひょ  | にょ  | ちょ  | しょ  | きょ  |

Notes

1. The above table is the same as before. Match the top consonants to the vowel sound on the right. Ex: きゃ = kya.
2. Also note that since 「じ」 is pronounced / ji /, all the small 「や」、「ゆ」、「よ」 sounds are also based off of that, namely: / jya / jyu / jyo /.
3. The same thing also applies to 「ち」 which becomes / cha / chu / cho / and 「し」 which becomes / sha / shu / sho /. (Though arguably, you can still think of it as / sya / syu / syo /.)

## The Small 「つ」

A small 「つ」 is inserted between two characters to carry the consonant sound of the second character to the end of the first.

For example, if you inserted a small 「つ」 between 「び」 and 「く」 to make 「びっく」, the / k / consonant sound is carried back to the end of the first character to produce "bikku".
Similarly, 「はっぱ」 becomes "happa", 「ろっく」 becomes "rokku" and so on and so forth.

**Examples**:
1. トラ***ッ***ク (to-ra***k***ku)  - truck
2. ざ***っ***し (za***s***shi)  - magazine
3. カ***ッ***プ (ka***p***pu)  - cup

Notes
1. A small 「つ」 is used to carry the consonant sound of the second character to the end of the first. Ex: 「がっき」 = "ga***k***ki".
2. The addition of another consonant almost always creates the characteristic clipping sound.
3. But make sure you're clipping with the right consonant (the consonant of the second character).

## The Long Vowel Sound

Simply extending the duration of a vowel sound. 

You can extend the vowel sound of a character by adding either 「あ」、「い」、or 「う」 depending on the vowel in accordance to the following chart.

| Vowel Sound | Extended by |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| / a /       | あ           |
| / i / e /   | い           |
| / u / o /   | う           |

For example, if you wanted to create an extended vowel sound from 「か」, you would add 「あ」 to create 「かあ」.

Other examples would include: 
- 「き → きい」
- 「く → くう」
- 「け → けい」
- 「こ → こう」
- 「さ → さあ」
- and so on.

When pronouncing long vowel sounds, try to remember that they are really two sounds merged together.
- It's important to make sure you hold the vowel sound long enough because you can be saying things like "here" （ここ） instead of "high school" （こうこう） or "middle-aged lady" （おばさん） instead of "grandmother" （おばあさん） if you don't stretch it out correctly!

**Examples**
1. がくせ***い*** (ga-ku-s***e***)  - student
2. せんせ***い*** (sen-s***e***)  - teacher
3. きょ***う*** (ky***o***)  - today
4. おはよ***う*** (o-ha-y***o***)  - good morning
5. おか***あ***さん (o-k***a***san)  - mother

There are rare exceptions where an / e / vowel sound is extended by adding 「え」 or an / o / vowel sound is extended by 「お」. 
- Some examples of this include 「おねえさん」、「おおい」、and 「おおきい」.
