All the resources you need to begin learning Kanji are on the web for free at [jisho.org](http://jisho.org/).
- In addition to its huge dictionaries, it has stroke order diagrams for the 1,945  [[Jouyo Kanji]]
	- you will want to repeatedly write out each Kanji to memorize the stroke order.
- Another important skill is learning how to balance the character so that certain parts are not too big or small.
- So make sure to copy the characters as close to the original as possible.
- Eventually, you will naturally develop a sense of the stroke order for certain types of characters allowing you to bypass the drilling stage.

 Their meaning Can be memorized with mnemonics
- Simply researching 'kanji name' + mnemonics
	- Be careful to not arrive on a Chinese site
- It's useful creating your own interpretation of how the shape relates with the meaning
# What is Kanji?

In Japanese, nouns and stems of adjectives and verbs are almost all written in Chinese characters called _Kanji_. Adverbs are also fairly frequently written in Kanji as well.

This means that you will need to learn Chinese characters to be able to read most of the words in the language.
- Not all words are always written in Kanji however.
- For example, while the verb "to do" technically has a Kanji associated with it, it is always written in [[Hiragana]]

There is no reason to dump the huge job of learning Kanji at the advanced level.
- By studying Kanji along with new vocabulary from the beginning, the immense job of learning Kanji is divided into small manageable chunks and the extra time helps settle learned Kanji into permanent memory.
- And by this, I don't mean studying five hours a day but rather reviewing how to write a Kanji once every several months until you are sure you have it down for good.

## Origin

They were inherited from Chinese Alphabet,
- Therefore a part of the original pronounce was kept
- But mixed with Japanese's 
- That's why most Kanji has at least 2 ways of being read.
	- Ex:
	- Water in Chinese is "Shui", and became "Sui"
	- But Water in Japanese is "Mizu"; so both sounds are associated with the word 

But not all at the same time
- That means some Kanji use archaic Chinese and others not
- And that some use archaic pronounce and others modern one

They started of as drawings instead of representing sounds
- So their meaning isn't always tied to the sound, but to a concept
- Their format was simplified over time, and quite a few no longer resemble their original.

# Reading Kanji

Almost every character has two different readings
- => Called 音読み (おんよみ) and 訓読み（くんよみ).
	- 音読み is the original Chinese reading
	- while 訓読み is the Japanese reading.
- Kanji that appear in a compound or 熟語 is usually read with 音読み while one Kanji by itself is usually read with 訓読み.
	- For example, 「力」（ちから） is read with the 訓読み
	- while the same character in a compound word such as 「能力」 is read with the 音読み （which is 「りょく」, in this case）.
- Certain characters can have more than one 音読み or 訓読み.
	- (especially the most common ones) 
	- For example, in the word 「怪力」,
		- 「力」 is read here as 「りき」 and not 「りょく」.
- Certain compound words also have special readings that have nothing to do with the readings of the individual characters.
	- (Thankfully, these readings are few and far in between).

訓読み is also used in adjectives and verbs in addition to the stand-alone characters.
	- These words often have a string of kana ([[Okurigana]]) that come attached to the word.

To explain the reading, the sound of the Kanji can be informed through [[Hiragana]] and [[Katakana]] on the top of the Kanji
- This is called [[Furigana]]. 

### Special Caes

Readings of Kanji can change slightly in a compound word to make the word easier to say.
- The more common transformations include the / h / sounds changing to either / b / or / p / sounds or 「つ」 becoming 「っ」.
- Examples include:
	- 一本
	- 徹底
	- 格好

There are also words that practically mean the same thing and use the same reading but have different Kanji to make just a slight difference in meaning.
- For example 「聞く」（きく） means to listen and so does 「聴く」（きく）.
    - The only difference is that 「聴く」 means to pay more attention to what you're listening to.
    - For example, listening to music almost always prefers 「聴く」 over 「聞く」. 「聞く」 can also mean 'to ask', as well as, "to hear" but 「訊く」（きく） can only mean "to ask".
- Yet another example is the common practice of writing 「見る」 as 「観る」 when it applies to watching a show such as a movie.
- Yet another interesting example is 「書く」（かく） which means "to write" while 描く （かく） means "to draw".
    - However, when you're depicting an abstract image such as a scene in a book, the reading of the same word 「描く」 becomes 「えがく」.

There's also the case where the meaning and Kanji stays the same but can have multiple readings
- such as 「今日」,
	- which can be either 「きょう」、「こんじつ」, or 「こんにち」.
- In this case, it doesn't really matter which reading you choose
- except that some are preferred over others in certain situations.

Finally, there is one special character 々 that is really not a character.

- It simply indicates that the previous character is repeated.
- For example,
	- 「時時」、「様様」、「色色」、「一一」
	- can and usually are written as 「時々」、「様々」、「色々」、「一々」.

	- and the rest is there only for the sound
	- Using a specific Chinese reading that matches the word in Japanese
- Depending on when it was brought to Japan, the same Kanji can be read differently. 
	- That is, have multiple Chinese readings
	- Both for meaning components and for sound components        

## [[Jukujikun]]

Basic Information:
- It ignores the Kanji common pronounce and uses only the meaning
- Ex:
	- "Kurage" (海月 or 水母, Jellyfish), using the kanji for sea and moon (or water and mother),
	- but neither of the pronounces  
## [[Ateji]]
